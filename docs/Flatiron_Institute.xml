The primary objective of the Biological Transport Networks group is to unravel the intricate relationships among the architecture of transport networks, their physical and developmental constraints, and their contribution to the overall fitness of the organisms they serve. Ultimately, we seek to integrate computation, theory and experimental data to bridge our micro- and mesoscopic knowledge of living processes and the intricacies of large-scale networks. By doing so, we aspire to unveil biological principles that can provide insights into comparative physiology across different species. Of particular interest is the modeling of transport networks across multiple scales, including their function, development and remodeling.
